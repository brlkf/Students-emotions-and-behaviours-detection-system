# Students emotions and behaviours detection system
## Overview
This project aims to leverage student behavior and facial expression detection to improve the quality of education in classroom settings. By using machine learning techniques, the system identifies key behavioral patterns that influence learning outcomes and provides insights to educators for better student engagement.

## Key Features:
* 	**Behavior Detection:** Identifies student behaviors such as hand-raising, reading, writing, distraction, focus, sleep, and phone usage.
* **Facial Expression Recognition:** Uses CNNs to detect student emotions in real-time.
* **Data Management:** Incorporates a student management system with a PySide6 interface and MongoDB database to store and analyze student data.
* **Automated Reporting:** Generates reports based on student engagement and behavior trends.
